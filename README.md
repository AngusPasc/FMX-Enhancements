FMX-Enhancements
================

A library of enhancements for FireMonkey in RAD Studio and AppMethod

NOTE: This library requires the LaKraven Studios Standard Library [LKSL] in order to function. You can download the LKSL freely and in open source from https://github.com/LaKraven/LKSL

INSTALLATION: Please run the FMXEInstall.exe file to configure your version(s) of the IDE to use the FMXE Library. It simply adds the FMXE source paths to RAD Studio's respective Search Paths. This executable can be re-run each time new paths are introduced in the FMXE.

Educational articles demonstrating the various features of the LKSL can be found at http://otapi.com
